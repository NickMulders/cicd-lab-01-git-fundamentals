# Lab 01 — Git Fundamentals

**Duration:** ~180 minutes (09:00 – 12:00)

* 09:00 – 09:30 — introduction (welcome to the series + logistics)
* 09:30 – 10:15 — Teaching: Introductions to git
* 10:15 – 10:45 — We-do
* 10:45 – 11:45 — You-do (breakout rooms)
* 11:45 – 12:00 — wrap-up & questions

This is the **first lab in the CI/CD series**, so we open with a short introduction to the
course as a whole before getting hands-on. After that it's one continuous lab. We deliberately blend Git's *object model* with the
*everyday workflow* so that the two reinforce each other: you'll watch `add -p` build the
index, watch a commit produce a fresh tree and blob, and come to see `rebase` as
"new commit objects, not moved ones." The object model isn't an abstract first hour — it's
the lens for every workflow move you make.

## Goal

You should leave this lab able to:

- Understanding the basic commands of git, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git status`, `git branch`, `git switch` (and the older `git checkout`), `git merge`, `git cherry-pick`
- Understand what `.gitignore` does and why Git tracks everything by default
- Actually understand what git is doing under the hood, how are blobs linked to commits, how every commit is a snapshot
- Choose between **merge** (fast-forward vs `--no-ff`) and **rebase** deliberately, and explain the tradeoffs
- Recover from "oh no I committed to the wrong branch"

## Introduction — welcome to the series (30 min)

Because this is the first class, the instructor opens with the bigger picture before we touch Git.

1. **Welcome & introductions.** Quick round-the-room: name, role, and one thing you want out of this course. 
2. **What this course is about.** This is a **CI/CD course for Ignition**. That means we're going to go deep into git, CI/CD, but it will be applied to Ignition and made very practical for that stance. This is not a pur Git course or a pure CI/CD course, it's really meant to give you practical tools in your day to day work 
3. **How the series fits together.** A rough map of where we're headed: A view on the calendar
4. **How the labs work.** Each lab follows the same rhythm: **Teaching**, **We-do** (instructor live-codes), **You do** (breakout rooms), then a **debrief**. There are optional stretch challenges if you finish early. Notes you take in `NOTES.local.md` are gitignored and yours to keep. We have 8 labs in total, where the last one will be a bigger challenge for you to fulfill in breakout rooms, where we will be there to guide you. Each lab has it's own git repo, so you will always have a fresh start, even if you where not able to complete the previous lab. 
5. **Breakout room rules** Sam and Jasper will float around breakout rooms to see who could use some help. We ask of everyone to share there screen at the same time in such breakout rooms, which will create the ability for us to have a 'look over you shoulder' kind of class. 
6. **AI Agents** Ofcourse, AI will be able to probably one-shot these labs, but we would challenge you to do this class as much as possible without it, so you actually get the fundamentals, and then you'll be able to steer AI much better when building this out for yourself.


## Teaching: Introductions to git (45 min)

The instructor teaches the foundations. This is the conceptual half — we *do* the moves in the
We-do that follows.

### Setup (do this first)

```bash
git switch main
git status        # should be clean
chmod +x scripts/seed-messy-state.sh
```

You should see a `sample-app/` directory with several commits already in its history. Run
`git log --oneline` and confirm you see at least five commits, and that the seed script is
available.

### Why version control matters

1. **Pre-VC pain.** `FINAL_v2_actual_REAL.zip`, lost work, no audit trail. Anyone who's been in industry long enough has a story.
2. **What a Version Control System (VCS) gives you.** History, blame, branching, safe undo. 
3. **Centralized vs distributed.** Why Git won. Why "every clone is a full backup" matters when the central server is down.
4. **Live folder-vs-repo contrast.** `mkdir scratch && cd scratch && echo hi > a.txt`. Then the same with `git init`. What's tracked? What isn't? What happens when you change `a.txt`?

Reference reading: [`docs/why-version-control.md`](../docs/why-version-control.md).

### The basic command vocabulary
A one-line tour of the commands you'll use every day — anchored to the folder-vs-repo demo above
so each one is concrete, not a glossary entry:

- `git init` — turn a plain folder into a repo (creates `.git/`).
- `git clone` — copy a remote repo (and its full history) to your machine.
- `git status` — what's changed, what's staged, what's untracked. Run it constantly.
- `git add` — stage a change for the next commit (moves it into the **index**).
- `git commit` — record the staged snapshot as a new commit.
- `git branch` — list or create branches (cheap pointers to commits).
- `git checkout` / `git switch` — move `HEAD` to another branch or commit. (`switch` is the modern, safer spelling for branches.)
- `git merge` — combine another branch's work into yours.
- `git cherry-pick` — copy a single commit onto your current branch.
- `git push` / `git pull` — send / receive commits to and from a remote. We **name** these now; we use them for real in later labs.

### `.gitignore` — telling Git what *not* to track

Git tracks **everything** by default. `.gitignore` is how you tell it what to leave alone — build
output, virtualenvs (`.venv`), `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache/`, OS/editor junk, and local-only notes
like `NOTES.local.md`.

- Open this repo's own [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore). Notice `.pytest_cache/` is already listed —
  that's exactly why running `pytest` during the You-do won't pollute your focused commit.
- `git status` shows **untracked** files (Git sees them, you haven't added them) separately from
  **ignored** files (Git pretends they aren't there). Knowing the difference saves you from the
  classic "why did my commit include `.venv/`?" mistake.

### The object model, conceptually

The thread for the rest of the lab: *every workflow command is really a manipulation of commits,
trees, and blobs.* Keep [`docs/git-object-model.md`](../docs/git-object-model.md) open as a cheat
sheet.

- **A commit is a tree.** Commits point to a *single* tree; trees point to blobs and sub-trees;
  blobs are *just* content (no filename). The filename lives in the tree entry.
- **Content-addressed.** An object's SHA *is* its content. Identical content is stored once;
  unchanged files are never re-stored.
- **The three pieces of working state:** **HEAD** (where you are), **refs** (named pointers like
  `main`), and the **index** (the staging area between your working tree and the next commit).

## We-do (30 min)

The instructor live-codes, narrating the object graph at every step — now we *do* the moves the
Teaching block described.

**1. A commit is a tree (quick recap).** Walk the existing `sample-app/` history:

1. `git log --oneline` — note one commit's SHA, e.g. `a1b2c3d`.
2. `git cat-file -p a1b2c3d` — read the commit object out loud. Note the `tree` line and the `parent` line. *That SHA is the **key**; `cat-file` prints the **value** — this is the key-value store from the slide.*
3. `git cat-file -p <tree-SHA>` — read the tree object. It lists blobs and sub-trees by SHA — the **filename lives in the tree entry**, exactly like the tree slide.
4. `git cat-file -p <blob-SHA>` — see the raw file content. (Confirm: the blob has no filename of its own.)

**2. What a commit actually does.** Now make the graph move:

1. Edit one line of `sample-app/README.md`.
2. `git add sample-app/README.md` — the **index** now holds a new blob, staged but not committed. `git status` shows the staged change.
3. `git commit -m "docs: tweak intro"` — a **new commit object** is born, pointing at a **new tree**, whose `README.md` entry points at a **new blob**. `HEAD` (a **ref**) advances to it.
4. `git cat-file -p HEAD`, then its tree, then the `sample-app` sub-tree, then the README blob — confirm only the README blob SHA changed; `app.py`'s blob is byte-for-byte the same SHA as before. *This is the snapshot slide made real: the commit is a **full snapshot**, but the unchanged blob is **reused, not re-stored**.*

**3. Branching and rewriting are just pointer moves and new objects.**

1. `git switch -c demo/throwaway` — a branch is a *cheap, **movable** pointer* to a commit (the moving label from the branches slide). Nothing is copied.
2. `git rebase -i HEAD~3` — reorder, squash, reword. Show the commit SHAs **change**: rebase doesn't *move* commits, it **creates new commit objects** and re-points the branch. Tie it straight back to "commits are immutable; their SHA is their content."
3. **Merge — fast-forward.** When `main` hasn't moved, `git merge demo/throwaway` just slides the `main` pointer forward. No merge commit. Linear history.
4. **Merge — `--no-ff`.** Advance `main` with a separate commit, then `git merge --no-ff demo/throwaway`. Now there **is** a merge commit. Prove the slide: `git cat-file -p HEAD` and **count the `parent` lines — there are two**. That two-parent commit *is* the three-way merge from the deck. Display the shape with `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all`.
5. **Oops-recovery.** "Oops, committed to main." Demo `git reset HEAD~1 --soft` — the ref moves back one commit but the change stays in the **index** — then `git switch -c feature/recovered && git commit`. Reinforce: `reset` moves a ref; your blobs didn't go anywhere.

## You-do (breakout rooms) (60 min)

Break into rooms. **Share your screen** so Sam and Jasper can float and look over your shoulder.
Open a scratch terminal and a scratch notebook (`NOTES.local.md` is gitignored).

We start with a short **guided warm-up together**, then you go solo through two phases on the same
clone. **Do Phase 1 first** — Phase 2 resets history and would erase Phase 1's checkpoint commit if
done out of order.

### Warm-up (together) — trace a commit, then stage by hunk

**Part 1 — trace a commit through the object graph.**

1. Make a small change to `sample-app/README.md` — add a single sentence.
2. `git add sample-app/README.md && git commit -m "docs: expand sample-app intro"`.
3. `git cat-file -p HEAD` — read it out loud. Note the `tree` SHA and the `parent` SHA.
4. `git cat-file -p <tree-SHA>` — this is the **root** tree, so the `README.md` entry you see here is the *repo's own* README, not the one you edited. Find the `sample-app` **sub-tree** entry instead, and note its SHA.
5. `git cat-file -p <sample-app-tree-SHA>` — *this* tree lists your `README.md`. Note its blob SHA.
6. `git cat-file -p <blob-SHA>` — confirm it matches your new file content.
7. `git ls-tree HEAD sample-app/` — the same walk in one command. The `README.md` blob SHA should match the one you just traced by hand.

**Part 2 — stage by hunk.** Reset back to a clean tree first: `git reset --hard HEAD~1` (this drops the practice commit above — that's fine, we're about to do it properly).

1. `git switch -c we-do-greeting-polish`.
2. `scripts/seed-messy-state.sh` — confirm with `git status` that you have a known dirty tree across `sample-app/`.
3. `git add -p` — stage **one** logical change, commit it. Repeat twice more, so you have three small commits. After each commit, glance at `git ls-tree -r HEAD sample-app/` and notice which blob SHA changed.
4. `git log --graph --decorate --oneline -5` — confirm your three commits sit on top of `main`.

> **Hint:** when `add -p` asks "Stage this hunk?", `y`/`n` is yes/no, `s` splits the hunk, `e` lets you hand-edit, `q` quits.

### Solo

Now work the two phases on your own. **Do Phase 1 first** — Phase 2 resets history and would erase
Phase 1's checkpoint commit if done out of order.

### Phase 1 — whodunnit, then a focused commit

The warm-up left you on a scratch branch — first return to a clean `main`:

```bash
git switch main
```

Jot each answer in `NOTES.local.md` as you go.

**Whodunnit? (1–4)**

1. Open `sample-app/app.py` and find the suspicious line inside `farewell()` — the one promising it's *"definitely safe to ship."*
2. Run `git blame sample-app/app.py`. Every line shows its **commit · author · date**.
3. **Who wrote that line?** Read the author off the blame output. Anyone you recognise…?
4. Read the full story of those lines: `git log -p -L :farewell:sample-app/app.py`. Blame finds the *who*, log finds the *why* — together they're how you reconstruct the reasoning behind any line.

**Focused commit + gate (5–7)**

5. **Make a focused commit.** Add your name to `sample-app/README.md` as a "lab participant" line. Commit it with a clear message.
6. Prove that **only the `README.md` blob changed**: compare `git ls-tree HEAD~1 sample-app/` with `git ls-tree HEAD sample-app/` — the `README.md` blob SHA differs, and every other entry (the `app.py` blob, the `tests/` tree) is identical.
7. **The gate.** Run `scripts/verify-lab.sh` — it should print all-green ✅. Run this **now**, before Phase 2: Phase 2 rewrites history, and the "HEAD touched only README" check no longer holds afterwards.

### Phase 2 — branch, merge, and rebase

Record your baseline now — `main` already includes your Phase 1 commit, and you'll reset
back here a few times:

```bash
git switch main
git rev-parse --short HEAD    # note this SHA — the instructions call it BASE
```

**Part A — three clean commits.**

1. `git switch -c feature/greeting-tweaks` from `main`.
2. Run `scripts/seed-messy-state.sh`. Confirm `git status` shows three changed files.
3. Use `git add -p` to produce **three separate commits**, each containing **one** of the three changes. Write a sensible message for each — imagine the reviewer needs to skim them in 30 seconds. (Lumped everything into one commit? Redo with `git reset HEAD~1 --soft` and try again.)

**Part B — a real merge commit.**

4. From Part A, `feature/greeting-tweaks` is **three commits ahead**; `main` still sits at your Phase 1 commit.
5. Put one small **unrelated** commit directly on `main` — edit a file the seed didn't touch, e.g. the root `README.md`, then `git commit -am "chore: unrelated note on main"`. Now the branches have **diverged**, so a fast-forward is impossible.
6. `git merge feature/greeting-tweaks` — Git can't fast-forward, so it records a **merge commit**.
7. `git cat-file -p HEAD` and **count the `parent` lines: two** — your own three-way merge commit from the slide. `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all` shows the diamond where the branches rejoin.
8. **Sketch the graph in `NOTES.local.md` and keep it** — in Part C you'll fold in the same feature work with a *linear* history instead.

**Part C — linear rebase.**

9. Reset once more: `git switch main && git reset --hard BASE` — this drops Part B's merge **and** its note commit. Then **redo the note commit** (edit the root `README.md` again, `git commit -am "chore: unrelated note on main"`) so `main` is ahead of the feature branch's fork point — without it, the rebase has nothing to do.
10. `git switch feature/greeting-tweaks && git rebase main`. The three feature commits should now sit on top of the new `main` tip, with no merge commit. (Notice the feature commits got **new SHAs** — rebase rewrote them.)
11. `git switch main && git merge feature/greeting-tweaks` — this *will* fast-forward. The history is linear.
12. Compare your final `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all` to the reference walk-through in [`instructor-notes/lab-key.md`](../instructor-notes/lab-key.md). Don't peek before you've finished Part C.

## Stretch challenges `[OPTIONAL]`

Only if you finish the two phases early. The first is the higher-value one for this lab; the second
is a deeper object-model dive for the curious; the third adds one more everyday tool to your belt.

**1. Rebase through a conflict.** After Part C, `main` and `feature/greeting-tweaks` point at the
**same commit** — a rebase would do nothing. Diverge them again first, then make `main` collide
with the feature's docstring commit. Same-region edits on both branches are what *forces* a conflict:

```bash
# 1 — pull main back behind the feature branch
git switch main
git reset --hard HEAD~3     # the 3 feature commits leave main but stay on feature/greeting-tweaks

# 2 — edit the same spot the feature's docstring commit touches
python3 - <<'PY'
from pathlib import Path
p = Path("sample-app/app.py")
t = p.read_text()
t = t.replace(
    '    message = f"Hello, {name}!"',
    '    # CONFLICT BAIT — main and your feature branch both edit greet()\n'
    '    message = f"Hello, {name}!"',
)
p.write_text(t)
PY
git commit -am "main: add a comment inside greet()"
```

Then `git switch feature/greeting-tweaks && git rebase main` — the feature commit that added a docstring to `greet()` touches the same spot, so Git halts with a conflict on that commit. Open `sample-app/app.py`, resolve (keep both the comment and the docstring), `git add sample-app/app.py`, then `git rebase --continue`. Confirm linear history with `git log --graph --decorate --oneline --all`. If you'd rather bail, `git rebase --abort` is also a valid exit.

**2. Diff without `git diff` (deeper dive).** Pick two adjacent commits in the seeded history. Using only `git cat-file` and `git ls-tree`, determine: which files exist in commit B but not A? For files in both, which blob SHAs differ? For the changed blobs, print both and identify the changed line(s) by eye. You're reconstructing what `git diff` does internally — a tree walk plus a blob comparison. Confirm with `git diff <A> <B>`.

**3. Cherry-pick one commit.** Grab a **single** commit from a branch without merging the whole thing — and watch it land as a **brand-new commit**:

```bash
git switch main && git reset --hard BASE    # main is behind your feature work again
git log --oneline feature/greeting-tweaks   # pick one commit's SHA

git cherry-pick <SHA>        # replays just that change onto main as a new commit
git log --oneline -2         # same change — NEW SHA

# other forms — pick what you need:
git cherry-pick <A> <B>      # a hand-picked few
git cherry-pick <A>~3..<A>   # a contiguous range
```

`cherry-pick` doesn't *move* a commit — it **replays the change as a new commit** on your current branch; `feature/greeting-tweaks` keeps its original. This is how you grab a single fix without merging a whole branch.

## Wrap-up & questions (15 min)

- Which of the "why VC matters" reasons resonated most with your day-to-day work?
- When does the object-model mental model *actually* matter in real life? (Hint: rebase conflicts, recovery with `git reflog`, understanding why `git mv` is just rename + commit.)
- One thing that surprised you about how Git stores files.
- Where would your team prefer **merge** over **rebase**, and why? Are there situations where the opposite is true?
- If a teammate committed straight to `main` and pushed it: what do they do *now*?
- Which commands do you want to alias? (e.g., `git lg` for `log --graph --decorate --oneline --all`)
